Lua/Corona SDK notes and snippets:

--Example of setting up a function and a listener to trigger/use it

	function screenTap()
		print("Tap sent to screen")
	end

	display.currentStage:addEventListener( "tap", screenTap )


To avoid the use of global variables, while still maintaining the ability to persist
data between scenes, you can create and require a simple lua file that contains something like:


--dataStore.lua

local M = {}
return M

That's it. Then just

local myGlobalSpace = require("dataStore.lua")


I got this info from the following article,
and it also goes more in depth with why to avoid global variables:
